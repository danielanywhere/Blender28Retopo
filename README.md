# Blender28Retopo
Retopology scripts for Blender 2.8 and higher.

None of the scripts in the folder have yet had any self-registering work done to them. To use any one of them, follow these general steps.

 - Copy the text of the script to your clipboard.
 - In Blender, activate the **Scripting** view.
 - In the text editor pane, click the **New** toolbar button.
 - Paste the content to the text window by pressing [Ctrl][V]. The script will be recognized as Python.
 - Press [Alt][P] to play the script.

Notes. Before running [RetopoSelectedDecimatePlanar.py](RetopoSelectedDecimatePlanar.py), pre-select objects to decimate in the **Layout** window or the object outliner prior to running the above steps.
